# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction
Developed a cardiovascular risk prediction system integrating IoT-based health sensors with machine learning algorithms for real-time risk analysis. The system collects vital parameters like heart rate and blood pressure, processes them using trained models, and alerts users about potential risks.
